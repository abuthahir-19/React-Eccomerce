# Ecommerce Product Information page
This project initially I take as a coding challenge from frontendmentor website to equip and also enhance my frontend coding skills to the next level. Initially I started to develop this project using traditional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript later after getting exposed to React framework it motivated me to convert this into a react application so it was then changed to react website which is also completely responsive in all devices. It is developed completely with custom CSS including media queries for RWD.
